# Emergency-SOS-Android

I developed this application as a part of my Summer Internship at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati in June, 2013 specifically for the Aakash Tablets. The main target audience of this app were school going girls. It enabled them to send a SOS message to their Emergency Contacts based on the user's preference in form of either e-mail, SMS or a recorded message via MMS by the virtue of just shaking their tablets.
