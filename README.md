# Emergency-SOS-Android

This application was developed as a part of my Summer Internship at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati for Aakash Bazar, the App Store for Aakash Tablets. The main target audience of this app were school/college going girls. It enabled them to send a SOS message to their Emergency Contacts based on the user's preference in form of either e-mail, SMS or a recorded message via MMS by the virtue of just shaking their tablets.
